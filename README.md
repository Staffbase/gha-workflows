# Reusable Workflows from the Enthusiasts ðŸŽ‰

The repository contains all general workflows which can be used for every workflow in another repository.
If you want to have more information you can take a look at the [GitHub documentation][1].

If you want to use a template workflow you can copy this template and adapt it to your specific use case.
You can find all possible template workflows in the directory `.github/workflows` with the name `template_*.yml`.

```yml
name: <your name>

on:
  ...

jobs:
  <action name>:
    uses: Staffbase/gha-workflows/.github/workflows/template_*.yml@v1.0.0
    with:
      ...
```

## Example Configurations

In the next sections you can find examples for the template workflows. For more information, please take a look at the templates.
