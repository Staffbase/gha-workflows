# Reusable Workflows from the Enthusiasts üéâ

The repository contains all general workflows which can be used for every workflow in another repository.
If you want to have more information you can take a look at the [GitHub documentation][reusable-workflows].

If you want to use a template workflow you can copy the following template and adapt it to your specific use case.
You can find all possible template workflows in the directory `.github/workflows` with the name `template_*.yml`.

```yml
name: <your name>

on:
  ...

jobs:
  <action name>:
    uses: Staffbase/gha-workflows/.github/workflows/template_*.yml@v7.2.0
    with:
      ...
```

## Example Configurations üîß

In this section you can find examples of how to use template workflows. For more information, please take a look at the templates.

### Auto-Merge Dependabot

<details>
<summary>The action can be used to auto-merge a dependabot PR with minor and patch updates.</summary>

The action is called by creating a PR. It is necessary that the repository is enabled for auto-merge.

‚ö†Ô∏è You can also force a merge of a PR. This means that the PR will immediately be merged.
If you want to enable the force merge, make sure that the app can bypass any protection rules.

## Limitations üöß

With the current implementation of the reusable workflows from GitHub, we have some usage limitations.

- It isn't possible to [access environment variables][reusable-workflow-env] and [secrets][reusable-workflow-secrets], so it's necessary to pass them to the workflow. But we don't want to do it for all secrets.

There are also some [further limitations][further-limitations] if you want to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Release üîñ

To create a new release just use [this page][release-new] and publish the draft release.
