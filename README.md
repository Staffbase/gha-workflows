# Reusable Workflows from the Enthusiasts ðŸŽ‰

The repository contains all general workflows which can be used for every workflow in another repository.
If you want to have more information you can take a look at the [GitHub documentation][reusable-workflows].

If you want to use a template workflow you can copy the following template and adapt it to your specific use case.
You can find all possible template workflows in the directory `.github/workflows` with the name `template_*.yml`.

```yml
name: <your name>

on:
  ...

jobs:
  <action name>:
    uses: Staffbase/gha-workflows/.github/workflows/template_*.yml@v2.6.0
    with:
      ...
```

## Example Configurations ðŸ”§

In this section you can find examples of how to use template workflows. For more information, please take a look at the templates.

## Limitations ðŸš§

With the current implementation of the reusable workflows from GitHub, we have some usage limitations.

- It isn't possible to [access environment variables][reusable-workflow-env] and [secrets][reusable-workflow-secrets], so it's necessary to pass them to the workflow. But we don't want to do it for all secrets.

## Release ðŸ”–

To create a new release just use [this page][release-new] and publish the draft release.
